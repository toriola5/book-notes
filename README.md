# ðŸ“š Book Notes
Book Notes is a Node.js web application for tracking books, managing notes, and organizing your reading progress.
It lets users add books with cover images, mark them as completed/not completed, rate them, and create chapter-based notes â€” all stored in a PostgreSQL database.
The app also integrates with the Open Library Covers API to fetch book cover images automatically.
